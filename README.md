# Spam-Detection-Project-Using-of-Machine-Learning
📧 Spam Detection using Naive Bayes & TF-IDF

📌 Overview

This project implements a Spam Detection system that classifies text messages (emails/SMS) as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
The project leverages TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction and Naive Bayes Classifier for efficient and accurate text classification.

🚀 Features

Preprocessing of raw text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).

Feature extraction using TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency).

Machine Learning model built with Multinomial Naive Bayes.

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Simple, fast, and effective solution for spam detection.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn

📊 Results

Achieved 95–98% accuracy (depending on dataset).

High precision and recall for spam classification.

TF-IDF improved performance compared to Bag-of-Words.

🔮 Future Improvements

Deploy the model using Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit for real-time spam detection.

Experiment with deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers) for higher accuracy.

Build a web app or mobile app for end-user spam filtering.
